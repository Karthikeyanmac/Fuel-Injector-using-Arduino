# Fuel Injector using Arduino
In my fuel injector project using Arduino, I designed a system to simulate the behavior of a fuel injector in an engine. The project involved controlling the fuel injection timing and duration using an Arduino board. A fuel injector model was created, and the Arduino was programmed to send pulses to simulate the opening and closing of the injector valve, mimicking how fuel is injected into the combustion chamber of an engine.

Components like a  LED  used to represent the injector's operation, and parameters like pulse width (representing the amount of fuel injected) were controlled through the Arduino's code. The project aimed to demonstrate how fuel injection can be managed electronically, which is crucial in modern engine management systems.
